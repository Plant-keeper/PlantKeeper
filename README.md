## About PROJECT

PROJECT is an innovative solution designed to help you effortlessly manage the well-being of your
home plants. The system combines hardware and software to monitor environmental conditions and ensure your plants
receive the optimal care they need.

Key Features:

- Sensor Integration: Place a sensor in the pot of your plant to continuously monitor humidity levels, UV light
  exposure, and room temperature. These real-time metrics will be used to help you maintain a healthy plant
  environment.
- User-Friendly Web App: Access the PROJECT system via an intuitive web application. You can create your profile and
  after logging in, you can add new sensors to use and plants to monitor. You can choose the type of your plant from a
  selection and link it to its specific sensor, allowing for personalized monitoring.
- Plant Monitoring Dashboard: View detailed information about each of your plants, including current humidity, solar
  exposure, and room temperature. This data is presented in an easy-to-read format, helping you understand your plant's
  needs at a glance. If one of the metrics falls outside the optimal range, its related symbol will become red, alerting
  you to take action. You can also know the global health status of your plant in a glance thanks to a health indicator.
  The indicator is in the form of a smiley face that changes its expression based on the plant's health status.
- Automated Notifications: Stay informed with email notifications that alert you when a plant needs watering or has
  received sufficient sunlight for the day. These reminders help you maintain optimal care routines without
  constant manual checking.
- Plant Information Database: Explore a comprehensive database of general plant care information, accessible directly
  within the web app. This feature provides valuable insights and tips tailored to different plant types, helping you
  make informed decisions about plant care and maintenance.

PROJECT is the perfect companion for plant enthusiasts, offering a seamless and intelligent way to
ensure your plants thrive.
