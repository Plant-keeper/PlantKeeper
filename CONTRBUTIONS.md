# How to contribute to PlantKeeper

Thank you for considering contributing to PlantKeeper! We welcome all contributions, including bug fixes, new features,
and improvements to documentation.

## Steps to contribute

1. Choose the repository you want to contribute to (backend, frontend, embedded) and fork it.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <link-to-your-forked-repo>
```

3. Create a new branch for your changes. The branch name should follow the naming convention. The naming convention is
   as follows:
    - For a bug fix: `bugfix/<short-description>`
    - For a new feature: `feature/<short-description>`
    - For documentation: `doc/<short-description>`

```bash
git branch <branch-name>
git switch <branch-name>
```

4. Make your changes and commit them. Make sure to describe your changes in the commit message.
5. Create an issue in the repository you are contributing to. The issue should follow the naming convention. The naming
   convention is as follows:
    - For a bug fix: `Bug: <short-description>`
    - For a new feature: `Feature: <short-description>`
    - For documentation: `Doc: <short-description>`
      The issue should have the label `extern-contribution` and all the other labels that apply. The description of the
      issue should contain a detailed explanation of the problem or the feature you are working on.
6. Push your changes to your forked repository.
7. Create a pull request to the original repository. The pull request should follow the naming convention. The naming
   convention is as follows:
    - For a bug fix: `Bugfix: <short-description>`
    - For a new feature: `Feature: <short-description>`
    - For documentation: `Doc: <short-description>`
      The pull request should reference the issue you created in step 5.
8. Wait for the maintainers to review your pull request. If there are any changes that need to be made, make them
   and push the changes to your forked repository. Once the maintainers approve your pull request, it will be merged
   into the original repository.
Once your pull request is merged, your contribution is complete! Congratulations and Thank you!
